# UNet: Image Segmentation Model

## Description
This project implements a U-Net convolutional neural network for image segmentation. U-Net is widely used in fields such as medical image analysis, where pixel-level classification is crucial. The model can effectively learn from a small dataset and accurately segment regions in images.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook
- Keras (if TensorFlow is used as the backend)
  

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UNet-Image-Processing.git
   cd UNet-Image-Processing
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies in Jupiter

3. Prepare your dataset:
   - The dataset should include images and their corresponding segmentation masks.
   - Ensure the paths to the images and masks are correctly specified in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook UNet.ipynb
   ```

2. Step through the notebook to:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Build and compile the U-Net model
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate the model performance

### Training the Model
- The U-Net model is trained on the dataset by specifying the number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters.
- Example of how the training process looks in the notebook:
   ```
   Epoch 1/50
   50/50 [==============================] - 20s 267ms/step - accuracy: 0.75 - loss: 0.085 - val_accuracy: 0.79 - val_loss: 0.062
   ```

### Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using common segmentation metrics such as:

- **Dice Coefficient**: Measures the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentation.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Evaluates the accuracy of segmentation by comparing predicted regions to actual regions.
- **Pixel Accuracy**: Indicates the proportion of correctly classified pixels.

Example evaluation results:
```
Validation Accuracy: 0.8217
Validation Loss: 0.0485
```

## Dataset
The model requires a dataset of images and corresponding binary masks. If using a medical imaging dataset, ensure that the images are in grayscale or RGB format, and the masks are binary (0 for background, 1 for the region of interest).

### Example Dataset Structure
```
/data
  /images
    - image_001.png
    - image_002.png
    ...
  /masks
    - mask_001.png
    - mask_002.png
    ...
```

Modify the paths in the notebook to point to your dataset.

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to perform segmentation on new images:
1. Load your trained model.
2. Pass the new images through the model using the `predict()` method.
3. Post-process the predicted output for visualization.

## Results
The U-Net model should output segmented images where the regions of interest are highlighted. Below is an example of the expected output:

| Original Image | Segmentation Mask | Prediction |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| ![image](./images/original.jpg) | ![mask](./images/mask.jpg) | ![predicted](./images/output.png) |
